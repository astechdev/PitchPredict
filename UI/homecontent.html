				You have seen the prototype but where do we go from here?  Well, glad you asked because we have ideas on top of ideas and each one builds on the other.  To start with we can add some more bells and whistles and make the tool more user friendly.  We can create a mobile app so that teams, coaches, players, and scouts can use PitchPredict anywhere.  We can expand PitchPredict to include minor league data.  We can make the tool more generalized to add the ability to analyze a broader set of situations.  And once we have completed all that?  Well, then we can start developing the really clever capabilities of PitchPredict.  We can develop algorithms that will optimize a pitchers approach to attacking a particular batter in a particular situation.  We can develop algorithms to compare pitchers and hitters across the different leagues.  These algorithms would be able to look at not just a players "stats" but also take into consideration a players "DNA".  We can look at how a play responds in certain situations and compare those responses to those of a successful major leaguer.  Could you imagine if you could identify a single A pitcher who responds to most situations the same way Nolan Ryan, or Roger Clemens, or Andy Pettite would have?  This is the future of sabermetrics.  This is the future of baseball.  This is PitchPredict!
